## Sentiment analysis on twitter 2020 election data
The 2020 US election is happening on the 3rd November 2020, today as of writing this kernel, and the resulting impact to the world will no doubt be large, irrespective of which candidate is elected! After reading the two papers, here and here, I was inspired to attempt a similar sentiment analysis myself!

However before I could do this I had to create a dataset first! Please feel free to download and use at your pleasure, the intention is to obtain data upto the end of the 4th of Nov. With regards to the dataset, ot contains two .csv files containing tweets obtained using snsscrape, keywords #JoeBiden, #DonaldTrump, ,#Biden #Trump with the Twitter API.
